# Hi, I'm Louisa

I'm computer science student at School 42 ! 

I am currently working on a [**GameBoy emulator**](https://github.com/louisabricot/gbmu) in Rust ðŸ¦€

When I am not, I learn about [**viruses**](https://github.com/louisabricot/virus) and how to develop them in RISC-V ðŸª±

One of this sentence is a lie.
